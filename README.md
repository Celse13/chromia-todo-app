## How It Works

The application works through the following flow:
1. Users connect their MetaMask wallet for authentication
2. Todo data is stored on the Chromia blockchain, ensuring decentralization and data integrity
3. The frontend communicates with the blockchain through [explain the interaction method]
4. Real-time updates are achieved through [explain the update mechanism]
5. All transactions are signed using MetaMask and recorded on the blockchain
