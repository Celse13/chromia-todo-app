In a new terminal

```bash
# Navigate to the blockchain directory
cd rell

# Install Chromia files
chr install

# Start the chain
chr node start

```

### 2. Frontend Setup

In a new terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd my-todo-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## How It Works

The application works through the following flow:
1. Users connect their MetaMask wallet for authentication
2. Todo data is stored on the Chromia blockchain, ensuring decentralization and data integrity
3. The frontend communicates with the blockchain through [explain the interaction method]
4. Real-time updates are achieved through [explain the update mechanism]
5. All transactions are signed using MetaMask and recorded on the blockchain
